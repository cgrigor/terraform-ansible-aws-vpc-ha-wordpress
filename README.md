# Basic Terraform Help
Before using the terraform, we need to export `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
```
To Generate and show an execution plan (dry run):
```
terraform plan
```
To Builds or makes actual changes in infrastructure:
```
terraform apply
```
To inspect Terraform state or plan:
```
terraform show
```
To destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure:
```
terraform destroy
```
**Note**: Terraform stores the state of the managed infrastructure from the last time Terraform was run. Terraform uses the state to create plans and make changes to the infrastructure.
